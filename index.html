	<p><img src = "assets/jeff.jpg" alt = "jeff.jpg" width = "300" height = "200">Jeff's transformation began 10 years ago as a young professional, enthusiastic to show his tenacity and skill in the booming field of computer program development.  Immediately after graduating college, Jeff had the life he always hoped at 22.  He married his college girlfriend and landed a lucrative first job as a programmer.  As a new employee, Jeff often worked 12 hour days and was hardly ever home.  After a year, he and his wife purchased a home and had their first child, but with that came more expenses and the need for him to continue working long hours.  Jeff realized while he had a stable job and found success in building a life and family, he was very unhappy and lost a sense of joy in the process.</p>

	<p>Jeff decided one day to make small changes and commit to improving his life through exercise and nutrition. Many professionals can relate to Jeff's story.  See how you can transform your life with Jeff today.</p>
